	<p class="changeable_text">I hadn't flown anywhere since I was a kid, about 15 years ago. And yet, there's a friend I hadn't seen in a long time who lives in Portland with his fiance. This led me to do the craziest thing I've done in a while and fly across the country, alone, to see him and explore Portland! I saw a good few museums, walked around a ton, did some hiking, and a ton more. This picture in particular, though, is interesting because not long after I took it, I saw a skateboarder go directly for the ramp and change his mind. He jumped off his board, which kept going, and he had to run after it, getting lucky and catching it just before it went in the water!</p>
	<h3>I also started a project (that I still haven't finished)</h3>
	<p>
		I hadn't really done many projects outside of class, so I decided to mess around and try some stuff out. I had finally found a D&amp;D group last semester so I was wondering if I could make a Discord bot that would pull from a wiki that the other bots weren't accepting as a valid website. At this point, I had never done anything with cURL, Gumbo, or D++ (the Discord API) and technically, I still haven't done anything with D++... On the other hand, I did teach myself how cURL works, as it will fetch sites for you in C++ which is my preferred language, and I started working with Gumbo to parse those sites (or site, since I was using one specific page to test things) but the semester started before the ball really got rolling... Anyway, here's a chunk of the table for the Sorcerer class that I almost have memorized from looking at the html of it so many times:
